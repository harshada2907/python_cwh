ABOUT DOCSTRINGS AND PEP8

Python docstrings are the string literals that appear right after the definition of a function, method,
class, module

-should be written right below the function definition otherwise will not br considered.

example:-

def square(n):     function definition
    '''Takes in a number n, and returns the square of n'''
    print(n**2)

square(5)          function call
print(square.__doc__)   this will also print my docstring


PEP8

-stands for PYTHON ENHANCEMENT PROPOSAL
-PEP9 is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write the python code.The primary
focus of pep8 is to improve the readability and consistency of python code.
